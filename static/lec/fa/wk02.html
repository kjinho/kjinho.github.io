<h1>IRAC Exercise</h1>
<p><strong>IRAC Exercise.</strong> Please read the following excerpt
from <em>Commonwealth v. Davis</em>, 10 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 192–93
(1980), and mark each portion of the paragraph that corresponds to the
ISSUE, RULE, APPLICATION, and CONCLUSION.</p>
<p>We turn now to the question whether human teeth or parts of the body
should be excluded from consideration by the fact finder as
instrumentalities which can be used as dangerous weapons in indictments
framed under G. L. c. 265, § 15A …. Section 15A punishes assaults and
batteries committed by “means of a dangerous weapon” but does not
expressly define the term “dangerous weapon.” Instead, the meaning of
the term has evolved through case law. Recently in <em>Commonwealth v.
Appleby</em>, 380 Mass. 296 (1980), the Supreme Judicial Court stated
that the concept of a dangerous weapon as used in § 15A embraces two
classes of objects—“dangerous weapons per se” (those specially designed
and constructed to produce death or great bodily harm, <em>id.</em> at
303); and objects which are not dangerous per se but which can be used
in a dangerous fashion to inflict serious harm. <em>Id.</em> at 304. A
wide variety of objects have been held to fall within the latter
category. <em>See Commonwealth v. Farrell</em>, 322 Mass. 606, 615
(1948) (lighted cigarette); <em>Commonwealth v. Tarrant</em>, 2 Mass.
App. Ct. 483, 486-487 (1974), S.C., 367 Mass. 411 (1975) (“kitchen-type”
knife and German shepherd dog); <em>Commonwealth v. LeBlanc</em>, 3
Mass. App. Ct. 780 (1975) (automobile door used to strike police
officer) …. We recognize that our cases have held that questions as to
whether instrumentalities which are not dangerous per se have been used
in a dangerous fashion are generally reserved to the fact finder to be
decided on the basis of the circumstances surrounding the crime, the
nature, size and shape of the object, and the manner in which it is
handled or controlled. <em>See Commonwealth v. Farrell</em>, 322 Mass.
at 614-615; <em>Commonwealth v. Tarrant</em>, 367 Mass. 411, 416 (1975)
(armed robbery); <em>Commonwealth v. Appleby</em>, 380 Mass. at 304-305.
However, for the reasons now discussed we think that human teeth and
other parts of the human body should be removed from consideration as
dangerous weapons in § 15A indictments, even on a case-by-case
basis.</p>

<h1>Issue Statements</h1>
<p>Formed as either</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an identification of the issue (“The issue is whether Mr. Doe’s
statement is admissible as an excited utterance ....”) or</p></li>
