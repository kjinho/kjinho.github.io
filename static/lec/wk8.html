Resendez</i>, 962 S.W.2d 539, 539-40 (Tex.<br/>1998).</p><blockquote><p>This case involves the proper scope of authority<br/>of law in a false imprisonment case. The court of appeals<br/>affirmed the trial court’s judgment against Wal–Mart Stores,<br/>Inc. (“Wal–Mart”) on a jury finding of false imprisonment.–––<br/>S.W.2d––––. We hold that, on the facts in this case, Wal–Mart<br/>established as a matter of law that it detained Lucia Resendez<br/>for a reasonable period of time, in a reasonable manner, and<br/>upon a reasonable belief that she had stolen store<br/>merchandise. Accordingly, we reverse the *540 court of<br/>appeals’ judgment and render judgment for Wal–Mart.</p><p>On January 20, 1986, Resendez went shopping at Wal–Mart<br/>during her lunch break. While browsing through the store, she<br/>began to eat from a bag of peanuts marked with a Wal–Mart<br/>price sticker. Raul Salinas, a security guard for Wal–Mart,<br/>followed Resendez and observed her place the empty bag under a<br/>rose bush. He then watched her purchase some items and leave<br/>the store. After determining that Resendez had not paid for a<br/>bag of peanuts, Salinas followed her into the parking lot. He<br/>accused her of taking the bag of peanuts without paying and<br/>asked her to accompany him back into the store. Resendez<br/>objected that she bought the peanuts the day before at another<br/>Wal–Mart store and could provide the receipt to prove it. She<br/>then accompanied Salinas to the back of the store. Within<br/>about ten to fifteen minutes a police officer arrived and<br/>arrested Resendez. Resendez posted bail and was released about<br/>one hour later.</p></blockquote></div><div class="slide"><h1>Client Letter</h1><ul><li>Who is the audience?</li><li>What is the purpose?</li></ul><div class="handout">For more information, see chapter 6 of the Bouchoux textbook.</div></div><div class="slide"><h1>Parts of the Client Letter</h1><ul><li>Letterhead</li><li>Date</li><li>Special Notations</li><li>Inside Address</li><li>Reference/Subject</li><li>Salutation</li><li>Body</li><li>Closing</li><li>Signature Block</li><li>Reference Initials, Enclosures, Copies</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Letterhead</h1><ul><li>Contact Information</li><li>Branding/Marketing</li><li>Only on First Page</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Date</h1><ul><li>Signals the “freshness” of the opinion</li><li>Use “full” date format: July 4, 1776</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Special Notations</h1><ul><li>Hand Delivered, Registered Mail, By Email</li><li>Attorney-Client Communication—Privileged and Confidential</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Inside Address</h1><ul><li>Name and Address of Recipient</li><li>Note: Do not use “Mrs.” for female recipients</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Reference/Subject</h1><ul><li>Include matter name and reference numbers, where applicable</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Salutation</h1><ul><li>Formal!</li><li>“Dear Ms. Smith:”</li><li>“Dear Sir or Madam:”</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Body</h1><ul><li>Introduction</li><li>Statement of Facts</li><li>Opinion</li><li>Explanation of Opinion</li><li>Recommendations</li><li>Instructions</li><li>Restrictions/Protection Clauses</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Protection Clause</h1><p>“We have based this opinion upon the facts you have provided us....”</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Closing</h1><ul><li>“Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.”</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Signature Block</h1><ul><li>“Sincerely,”</li><li>“Very truly yours,”</li><li>“Best regards,”</li><li>“Respectfully,”</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Reference Initials, Enclosures, Copies</h1><ul><li>“LEM/mjs” means Leonard E.

The document is not in the appropriate format.</td><td>The document fails to comply with the mandated word-count limit, but it includes all necessary sections. The document is in the appropriate format, but there are inconsistencies or errors in the formatting.</td><td>The document complies with the mandated word-count limit and includes all necessary sections. The writer has formatted the document consistently and appropriately.</td></tr></table><h1>Introduction</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The introduction fails to identify the issue, fails to include facts for context, and fails to give sufficient context for the letter’s purpose.</td><td>The introduction identifies the issue, includes factual context, and states the letter’s purpose. The legal theory lacks sufficient specificity or relies excessively on legalese. The included facts provide some context but fail to individuate the issue.</td><td>The introduction identifies the relevant issue with precision, includes case-specific facts that give the issue helpful context, and clearly establishes the purpose of the letter.</td></tr></table><h1>Statement of Facts</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The statement of facts fails to contain what a reader needs to understand the factual circumstance of the matter. It is unclear who the parties are. It is unclear what the nature of the dispute is. The writer has omitted critically important facts and has included irrelevant and unnecessary information. There is little or no recognizable organization of the facts. There is no indication of the source of the facts.</td><td>The statement of facts contains most of what a reader needs to understand the factual circumstance of the matter. The writer identifies the parties and nature of the dispute. The writer includes most of the important facts and has omitted most irrelevant or unnecessary information. The organization of the facts is comprehensible, although the writer could improve the organization by using chronological order. The letter states the source of the facts.</td><td>The statement of facts contains everything a reader needs to understand the factual circumstance of the matter. The writer includes a brief introductory paragraph that identifies the parties and the nature of the dispute. The writer organizes the facts clearly and in chronological order. The writer includes all facts that he or she later relies on in the discussion and omits irrelevant and unnecessary information. The source of the facts is clear.</td></tr></table><h1>Opinion</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The letter fails to state an opinion responsive to the issue.</td><td>The letter states an opinion, but the opinion is either unclear or difficult to locate within the letter.</td><td>The letter states a clear opinion responsive to the issue. The letter uses the language of probability to frame the opinion.</td></tr></table><h1>Explanation of Opinion (Discussion)</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The writer fails to use IRAC correctly to organize the discussion. The writer fails to begin each paragraph with a topic sentence. The discussion lacks an appropriate concluding sentence or paragraph. The writer fails to include a separate IRAC for each legal element that requires analysis.</td><td>The writer uses IRAC to organize the discussion. The introductory paragraph is missing a “roadmap,” or the roadmap that it provides does not match the discussion that follows. Some, but not all, of the paragraphs in the discussion begin with a topic sentence. The discussion lacks an appropriate concluding sentence or paragraph that terminates the IRAC that began in the discussion’s introductory paragraph. The writer includes a separate IRAC for each legal element that requires analysis.</td><td>The writer uses IRAC in a clear, consistent way to organize the discussion. Each paragraph in the discussion begins with a topic sentence. The discussion ends with an appropriate concluding sentence or paragraph that terminates the IRAC that began in the discussion’s introductory paragraph. The writer includes a separate IRAC for each legal element that requires analysis. For each element discussed, the writer—in this order—states the issue and the rule, explains the rule, applies the rule, and sums up the analysis in a concluding sentence or sentences.</td></tr></table><h1>Recommendations and Instructions</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The conclusion fails to answer the issue. The conclusion lacks questions or recommendations for the reader.</td><td>The conclusion answers all issue. The conclusion also contains questions, recommendations, or instructions for the reader. These questions or recommendations are either minimally relevant or largely unhelpful.</td><td>The conclusion answers all issues clearly and succinctly.

The document contains numerous spelling, grammar, or typing errors.</td><td>The writer uses mostly simple, subject-verb-object sentences, although some sentences are unnecessarily complex or compound. The writer uses the passive voice more than once in the document. The writer uses correct, but unnecessarily complex words. The paragraphs are mostly of appropriate length (normally at least 2 or 3 sentences long, and no longer than three-quarters of a page). The document contains few spelling, grammar, or typing errors.</td><td>The writer uses simple, subject-verb-object sentences. The writer uses the active voice and avoids the passive voice. The writer uses simple, familiar words. The writer avoids the overuse of prepositions and prepositional phrases. The paragraphs are of appropriate length (normally at least 2 or 3 sentences long, and no longer than three-quarters of a page).
