BMP</h1><ul><li>Ms. Brown is a medical records clerk [for BMP] ....</li><li>About five minutes into her walk, Ms. Brown was knocked down by a young man learning how to skateboard. She broke her arm and dislocated her shoulder in the accident. She missed one month of work due to her injuries. Ms. Brown is still recovering and expects she will need physical therapy for the next three to six months.</li><li>Ms. Brown filed a workers’ compensation claim for lost wages and healthcare expenses.  The issue before the court is whether she can recover under Alabama’s Workers’ Compensation Law.</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Relevant Law</h1><ul><li>Ala. Code § 25-5-1 (1975)</li><li>“In order for the claimant’s injuries to be compensable under the Alabama Workmen’s Compensation laws, the accident must arise out of and occur in the course of his employment.” <i>Sun Papers, Inc. v. Jerrell</i>, 411 So. 2d 790, 793 (Ala. Civ. App. 1981).</li><li>“The phrase ‘arising out of’ an employee’s employment requires a causal connection between the injury and the employment. ... The phrase ‘in the course of’ the employee’s employment refers to the time, place, and circumstances under which the accident occurred.”<br/><i>Waffle House, Inc. v. Howard</i>, 794 So. 2d 1123, 1128 (Ala. Civ. App. 2000).</li><li>“It is well settled that work-connected activity goes beyond the direct services performed for the employer and includes at least some ministration to the personal comfort and human wants of the employee. ... Such acts which are necessary to the life, comfort, and convenience of the employee while at work, though strictly personal to himself, and not acts of service are incidental to the service. Therefore, an injury sustained in the performance thereof is deemed to have arisen out of the employment.”<br/><i>Gold Kist, Inc. v. Jones</i>, 537 So. 2d 39, 41 (Ala. Civ. App. 1988)</li></ul></div></body>
