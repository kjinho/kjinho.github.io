<p>
Damian Desmond recently hired our firm to represent him in a potential
civil action against the state. As you may know, Mr. Desmond served
more than twenty years in prison for a crime that he did not commit.
Mr. Desmond is now 40 years old. When he entered prison, he was
only 18. The world is dramatically different now, and Mr. Desmond
would benefit from resources that will allow him to lead a meaningful
life as a free man.
</p>

<p>
Another associate has found that the Massachusetts Erroneous Felony Conviction
Statute (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 256D, §§ 1 et seq.)
offers one potential legal basis for a claim against the state.
</p>

<p>
Please draft a complaint we can file to initiate a lawsuit against the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts under the Erroneous Felony Conviction
Statute.

<p>
Barbara Posner, <i>Wrongfully Convicted Man Freed after Serving More Than Ten Years</i>,
Boston Post, Mar. 1, 2022, at A1.
</p>

<p>
After county prosecutors filed their notices of dismissal today,
Damian Desmond walked out of the Suffolk County Superior Courthouse
today a free man for the first time in more than twenty years.
</p>

<p>
For decades, Mr. Desmond claimed that he was innocent the grisly
murder of Yuri Briar, then an officer with the Boston Police
Department. Officer Briar was on duty when a hooded man attacked him
with a knife. There was a lengthy struggle; the hooded man escaped,
leaving Officer Briar dead. A witness to the incident identified
Mr. Desmond as the culprit, and a jury later convicted Mr. Desmond of
the murder. A superior court judge sentenced Mr. Desmond to serve a
life sentence at the state prison in Walpole, where Mr. Desmond has
been incarcerated ever since.
</p>

<p>
But recent court filings show that testing of DNA evidence discovered
on the knife has exonerated Mr. Desmond.
</p>

<p>
Judge Sylvia Sherwood issued a brief ruling today that threw out the
murder conviction. After she issued the ruling, prosecutors told
the judge that they would be dropping the charges, and Mr. Desmond
became a free man once again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a horrible, harrowing twenty-two years, but I&rsquo;m so happy
that I can finally come home,&rdquo; Mr. Desmond said.

v.

DAMIAN DESMOND


\underline{ORDER GRANTING MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL}

\end{centering}

</div>

<p>
This case arises from the stabbing death of Yuri Briar during the
early morning hours of February 12, 2000. The murder was a grisly
affair, involving a lengthy struggle between the victim and the
murderer, who fled shortly after the victim&rsquo;s death. The police could
not immediately identify the culprit, but descriptions of the culprit
led police to arrest the Defendant Damian Desmond a few days later. An
eyewitness subsequently identified Desmond in a photo array.
</p>

<p>
The testimony of the eyewitness formed the centerpiece of the
Commonwealth&rsquo;s prosecution of Desmond as the murderer. A jury of this
Court found Desmond guilty of murder in the first degree, and this
Court entered a judgment of conviction, sentencing Desmond to life
imprisonment in the state prison in Walpole. The Supreme Judicial
Court affirmed the conviction.
</p>

<p>
After the legislature&rsquo;s 2012 enactment of an Act Providing Access to
Forensic and Scientific Analysis, Desmond began seeking further review
of his case. Those efforts bore fruit. As outlined in the affidavits
submitted to this Court, DNA analysis of the blood collected at the
scene of the attack and on the knife conclusively excludes Desmond as
a potential source of the DNA. Based on this newly discovered
evidence, Desmond and the Commonwealth now jointly request that the
Court vacate judgment of conviction.
</p>

<p>
Although the Court has questions as to why the Commonwealth never
analyzed the DNA evidence before, it sees no reason to delay
Desmond&rsquo;s release.
</p>

<p>
The joint motion of the parties being before it, the Court hereby
ALLOWS the motion and vacates the conviction of Defendant Damian
Desmond for murder in the first degree.

<p>
The Commonwealth hereby enters a <i>nolle prosequi</i>

Defendant was not the assailant responsible
for the death of Yuri Briar.

\item ... 

\item those who have been granted judicial relief by a state court of competent jurisdiction, on grounds which tend to establish the innocence of the individual as set forth in clause (vi) of subsection (C), and if

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item the judicial relief vacates or reverses the judgment of a felony conviction, and the felony indictment or complaint used to charge the individual with such felony has been dismissed, or if a new trial was ordered, the individual was not retried and the felony indictment or complaint was dismissed or a nolle prosequi was entered, or if a new trial was ordered the individual was found not guilty at the new trial; and

\item at the time of the filing of an action under this chapter no criminal proceeding is pending or can be brought against the individual by a district attorney or the attorney general for any act associated with such felony conviction.

\item he was sentenced to incarceration for not less than 1 year in state prison or a house of correction as a result of the conviction and has served all or any part of such sentence;

\item he was incarcerated solely on the basis of the conviction for the offense that is the subject of the claim;

\item he did not commit the crimes or crime charged in the indictment or complaint or any other felony arising out of or reasonably connected to the facts supporting the indictment or complaint, or any lesser included felony; and

</p>

<div>
\begin{enumerate}[(A)]

\item Upon a finding or verdict that the claimant has met the requirements of section 1 by the requisite standard of proof and is not barred from compensation by section 2, the court or the jury shall determine the damages that shall be payable to the claimant. In making such determination, the court or jury shall consider, but not be limited to, the consideration of: the income the claimant would have earned, but for his incarceration; the particular circumstances of the claimant’s trial and other proceedings; the length and conditions under which the claimant was incarcerated and; any other factors deemed appropriate under the circumstances in order to fairly and reasonably compensate the claimant. The court, in its discretion, may admit expert testimony on these or any factors. The court may include, as part of its judgment against the commonwealth, an order requiring the commonwealth to provide the claimant with services that are reasonable and necessary to address any deficiencies in the individual’s physical and emotional condition and waive tuition and fees for the claimant for any educational services from a state or community college in the commonwealth including, but not limited to, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and its satellite campuses. Once the damages have been determined, the court shall enter a judgment against the commonwealth for the claimant in an amount certain, payable in either a lump sum or in annuity installment payments set by the court; provided, however, that any such annuity installment payments shall have fixed limits on their annual amount and on the time period which they shall be paid to the claimant. A judgment against the commonwealth may not include punitive or exemplary damages. The total liability of the commonwealth for any judgment entered under this chapter shall not exceed \$1,000,000. Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the clerk of court shall not add to the judgment and the commonwealth shall not be liable for paying, any prejudgment or post judgment interest on damages. Subject to section 4, relative to award or settlements, the rights and remedies afforded to certain individuals by this chapter are not intended to limit in any way any rights or remedies that such individuals or other individuals may be entitled to exercise and pursue under chapter 258.

\item In awarding damages under this section, the court or jury shall not offset the award by any expenses incurred by the commonwealth or any political subdivision of the commonwealth including, but not limited to, expenses incurred to secure the claim\-ant’s custody, or to feed, clothe or provide medical services for the claimant nor shall the court offset against the award the value of any reduction in tuition or fees for educational services or the value of services to be provided to the claimant that may be awarded to the claimant pursuant to this section.
