<p>
The following is an excerpt from <i>Jinks v. Credico (USA) LLC</i>, 488 Mass.
691, 692-93, 177 N.E.3d 509, 513 (2021) (Wendlandt, J.). The first two
sentences of the excerpt constitute (1) a statement of the issue and
(2) the conclusion. The third and fourth sentences state the (now)
applicable rule. The next sentence, which begins a new paragraph,
outlines the conclusion again in light of the rule. This outline
serves as a roadmap.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;font-style:normal;">
<b>[ISSUE/THESIS]</b> This case presents the issue whether G.L. c. 149, § 148B
(independent contractor statute), which sets forth the standard to
classify an individual as an employee or an independent contractor for
purposes of the minimum wage and overtime statutes, G.L. c. 151, §§ 1
and 1A (wage laws), also establishes the standard to determine whether
an entity is that individual&rsquo;s joint employer for purposes of those
laws. We conclude that it does not. <b>[RULE]</b> Instead, we borrow the test
applied to determine joint employer status under the Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA), from which the Massachusetts wage laws derive.
Pursuant to that test, whether an entity is a joint employer of an
individual is determined by considering the totality of the
circumstances of the relationship between the individual and the
entity, guided by a framework of four factors: whether the entity (1)
had the power to hire and fire the individual, (2) supervised and
controlled the individual&rsquo;s work schedules or conditions of
employment, (3) determined the rate and method of payment, and (4)
maintained employment records.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;font-style:normal;">
<b>[ROADMAP]</b> Considering these factors in light of the undisputed
material facts in the record before us, we affirm the Superior Court
judge&rsquo;s allowance of summary judgment in favor of the defendant,
Credico (USA) LLC (Credico).

<h3 id="orgeab5de4"><span class="section-number-3">3.5.</span> Example (Complicated)</h3>
<p>
The following excerpt is a more complicated example of introductory
paragraphs. Although the first paragraph does not fit the recommendation of
beginning with a thesis statement and the rule, the excerpt contains a
detailed roadmap. This roadmap summarizes the various parts of the
court&rsquo;s decision.
</p>

<p>
Why doesn&rsquo;t Justice Kimberly Budd&#x2014;now the Chief Justice of the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court&#x2014;state the rule in these
introductory paragraphs? The case concerns which rule should apply,
and the justices of the court could not agree on a single rule.
Therefore, stating a rule was simply not possible.
</p>

<blockquote >
<p style="text-align:left;font-style:normal;">
[ISSUE] Until recently, we provided only limited guidance regarding
legal instructions furnished to grand juries. We had held, for
example, that “it is the duty of the district attorney in appropriate
instances to advise [the grand jury] concerning the law,” &#x2026; and that
an appropriate instance for such instructions is when the grand jury
request them &#x2026; . Then, in <i>Commonwealth v. Walczak</i>, &#x2026; we held that
where the Commonwealth seeks to indict a juvenile for murder, and
substantial evidence of mitigating circumstances or defenses (other
than lack of criminal responsibility) is presented to a grand jury,
the Commonwealth must instruct the grand jury on the elements of
murder and on the legal significance of those mitigating circumstances
or defenses. &#x2026; We are called on in this case to determine
whether the Commonwealth&rsquo;s failure to provide instructions to the
grand jury regarding the significance of the mitigating evidence it
presented requires dismissal of an indictment against an adult for
murder in the first degree.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;font-style:normal;">
[ROADMAP] As reflected in this plurality opinion and in the separate opinions
that follow, six Justices are of the view that it is generally
advisable for prosecutors to instruct grand juries on the elements of
lesser offenses and defenses whenever such instructions would help the
grand jury to understand the legal significance of mitigating
circumstances and defenses.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;font-style:normal;">
The Justices disagree, however, as to the consequences of failing to
provide such instructions. The three Justices who subscribe to this
plurality opinion would hold that the integrity of a grand jury is
impaired, and the dismissal of an indictment due to the lack of
instructions is therefore appropriate, only when the instructions
likely would have given effect to a complete defense—in other words,
only where the exculpatory evidence presented to the grand jury was so
compelling that giving instructions on that evidence probably would
have resulted in the grand jury returning a no bill. Two
Justices—Chief Justice Gants and Justice Lenk—would hold that a
prosecutor&rsquo;s failure to give a grand jury appropriate instructions on
mitigating circumstances and defenses ought to result in the dismissal
of an indictment if the absence of instructions probably influenced
the grand jury&rsquo;s decision to return an indictment for murder as
opposed to manslaughter or a no bill. Two other Justices—Justice
Cypher and Justice Lowy—would hold that the integrity of a grand jury
is impaired by a prosecutor&rsquo;s failure to give instructions only in
cases where there has been affirmative prosecutorial misconduct, i.e.,
only if and when the facts known to the prosecutor clearly establish
that the instruction would result in a complete exoneration, yet the
prosecutor withholds appropriate instructions.
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;font-style:normal;">
Because this case fails to satisfy the standards for dismissal set
forth in this plurality opinion and in Justice Cypher&rsquo;s concurring
opinion, five Justices (those who subscribe to this opinion and
Justice Cypher&rsquo;s opinion) agree that, here, the indictment should not
have been dismissed.

<b>[ISSUE]</b> The primary question on appeal is whether the District Court
properly found in favor of Vortic and Custer on Hamilton&rsquo;s federal
trademark infringement claim. <b>[RULE]</b> A plaintiff alleging trademark
infringement in violation of the Lanham Act &ldquo;must demonstrate that (1)
&lsquo;it has a valid mark that is entitled to protection&rsquo; and that (2) the
defendant&rsquo;s &lsquo;actions are likely to cause confusion with [that] mark.&rsquo;&rdquo;
<i>Tiffany &amp; Co. v. Costco Wholesale Corp.</i>, 971 F.3d 74, 84 (2d
Cir. 2020) (alteration in original) (quoting <i>The Sports Auth., Inc. v.
Prime Hosp. Corp.</i>, 89 F.3d 955, 960 (2d Cir. 1996)). <b>[ROADMAP]</b> The
parties do not dispute the validity of Hamilton&rsquo;s trademark or that
The Lancaster featured that trademark. We therefore focus on whether
the District Court erred in finding no likelihood of consumer
confusion in the watch&rsquo;s use of that trademark.

<p style="text-align:left;font-style:normal;">
[This case raises the issue of whether the defendant infringed
plaintiff&rsquo;s trade mark. To prevail on trademark infringement claim, a]
&#x2026; plaintiff must show &ldquo;a probability of confusion, not a mere
possibility,&rdquo; affecting &ldquo;numerous ordinary prudent purchasers.&rdquo;
<i>Gruner + Jahr USA Publ&rsquo;g v. Meredith Corp.</i>, 991 F.2d 1072, 1077 (2d
Cir. 1993). &#x2026;
</p>

<p style="text-align:left;font-style:normal;">
We have identified a non-exhaustive list of factors for district
judges to analyze when considering whether a mark&rsquo;s use is likely to
cause confusion. <i>See Polaroid Corp.</i>, 287 F.2d at 495. These so-called
<i>Polaroid</i> factors are: (1) &ldquo;the strength of [the] mark&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;the
degree of similarity between the two marks&rdquo;; (3) &ldquo;the proximity of the
products&rdquo;; (4) &ldquo;the likelihood that the prior owner will bridge the
gap&rdquo;; (5) &ldquo;actual confusion&rdquo;; (6) &ldquo;the reciprocal of defendant&rsquo;s good
faith in adopting its own mark&rdquo;; (7) &ldquo;the quality of defendant&rsquo;s
product&rdquo;; and (8) &ldquo;the sophistication of the buyers.&rdquo; <i>Id.</i>; <i>accord

<blockquote >
<p style="text-align:left;font-style:normal;">
Examining all of the <i>Polaroid</i> factors as a whole, we hold that no
reasonable jury could conclude that RAC&rsquo;s customers are likely to be
confused by Gimlet&rsquo;s use of its &ldquo;REPLY ALL&rdquo; mark. Not a single factor
favors RAC, and although the Polaroid factors are not exclusive, <i>see,
e.g., Guthrie</i>, 826 F.3d at 37 &amp; n.3, RAC points to no additional
factors beyond the Polaroid framework that suggest a likelihood of
confusion. Particularly in light of the weakness of RAC&rsquo;s mark and the
lack of competitive proximity between the parties&rsquo; products, we affirm
the district court&rsquo;s grant of summary judgment in favor of Gimlet.
