<hr />

<p>
This firm represents Sidney Young. As you know, Mr. Young was recently
involved in a serious single-car accident that caused him serious
injuries.
</p>

<p>
The liability phase of the trial has just concluded. Please draft
a closing argument to the jury to explain why the jury should
find Mr. Gardner liable for Mr. Young&rsquo;s injuries.
</p>

<p>
I have enclosed a copy of the judge&rsquo;s instructions to the jury, as
well as copies of the trial transcript.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-2-2">

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><a id="org8ffe28b"></a>Burden of Proof<br />
<p>
When a person files a civil case, he has the burden of proof.
That means that he must present enough evidence to prove
his claims. What is enough evidence?
</p>

<p>
I will tell you in a minute each of the specific things that Sidney
Young must prove. Sidney Young must show that each of these things is
more likely true than not true. The lawyers or I may use the phrase
“more probable than not,” and that means the same thing as “more
likely true than not true.”
</p>

<p>
Now, from time to time, I will refer to proof or to proving something.
By this, I mean showing that Sidney Young’s version of the facts is
more likely true than not true, based upon evidence and any reasonable
conclusions from the evidence.
</p>

<p>
If you find that the evidence supporting Sidney Young’s version of the
facts is more persuasive, then you must decide in favor of Sidney
Young. But if you find that the evidence supporting Riley Gardner’s
version of the facts is more persuasive, or that the evidence on the
two sides is equally persuasive—50/50—then you must decide in favor of
Riley Gardner.
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="org387b60f"></a>Credibility<br />
<p>
A very important part of your job as jurors is to decide who and what
to believe. You may believe everything a witness says, part of it, or
none of it.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes people do not tell the truth. You must decide whether a
witness was being truthful, or was deliberately lying. If you conclude
that a witness lied to you about something, then of course you should
not believe that part of the testimony.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes people make an honest mistake. You must also decide whether
a witness testified accurately, or whether the witness may have gotten
something wrong without meaning to do so. A witness may recall seeing
or hearing something, but actually be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
For example, the witness might not have paid close attention or might
have misunderstood what was happening. Or a witness’s memory of what
happened could be incorrect.
</p>

<p>
If you conclude that a witness tried to be truthful but that some part
of the person’s testimony was not accurate, then you should not
consider the inaccurate testimony.
</p>

<p>
How do you decide whether you believe particular statements by a
witness? Ask yourself:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Did the testimony seem reasonable or probable?</li>
<li>Did the witness have a good chance to observe what happened? How
much attention did the witness pay?</li>
<li>Does the witness’s memory seem accurate?</li>
<li>Was the witness’s testimony consistent with other evidence, or
instead contradicted by other evidence?</li>
<li>How did the witness behave and answer questions?</li>
<li>Did the witness have any motive for testifying in a certain way or
have any other bias that may have influenced the witness’s
testimony?</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><a id="org4896db1"></a>Negligence<br />
<p>
Sidney Young claims that Riley Garnder was negligent in operating
a motor vehicle. The fact that Sidney Young has filed this lawsuit is not
evidence that Riley Gardner was negligent or caused any injuries. To prove
negligence, Sidney Young must show that the following three things are
more likely true than not true:
</p>

<ol>
<li>That Riley Gardner failed to use reasonable care under all of the
circumstances; and</li>
<li>That Riley Gardner’s failure to use reasonable care was a cause of
Sidney Young’s injury or harm.</li>

</ol>

<p>
I will now describe each of these things in more detail.
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="org9ac14d8"></a>Breach of Duty<br />
<p>
First, Sidney Young must prove that Riley Gardner more likely than not
failed to use reasonable care under the circumstances. That failure
might have occurred through action or inaction. You must consider all
the evidence and then make a judgment about what a reasonably careful
person would have done.
</p>

<p>
You should consider what Riley Gardner did or failed to do. Then you
should consider all of the relevant circumstances. For example, you
may ask the following questions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Where, when and how did the incident occur?</li>
<li>How likely was it that people could be injured?</li>
<li>How serious was the potential injury?</li>
<li>How obvious should the risk have been to DFT?</li>
<li>Was there any emergency?</li>
<li>How much of a burden would it have been to avoid the injury?</li>

</ul>

<p>
Then you make a judgment. The law requires a person to use reasonable
care to avoid predictable injuries to people. We ask you, the jury, to
consider what a reasonable and careful person would have done under
these circumstances. What you consider reasonable may vary depending
on the circumstances of this case. A person should take greater
precautions as the risk of harm increases. You should also ask
yourself: “Did Riley Gardner actually know about any risks?” And, if
not: “Should he have known about them?”
</p>

<p>
A driver of a motor vehicle must act as a reasonably careful person
would act in similar circumstances. A driver must use reasonable care:
</p>

<ul>
<li>to avoid placing himself/herself or others in danger,</li>
<li>to keep a proper lookout,</li>
<li>to follow all traffic signs and signals,</li>
<li>to make reasonable observations about traffic and weather conditions,</li>
<li>to obey all motor vehicle laws,</li>
<li>to maintain control of his/her vehicle and not be distracted, and</li>
<li>to avoid a collision.</li>

</ul>

<p>
As harm becomes more likely, the driver must be more careful. For
example, a driver must be more careful when driving in an area full of
pedestrians than in an area where no pedestrians are present. And as
the threatened harm becomes more severe, the driver must be more
careful. For example, someone driving at a high speed near other
vehicles needs to be more careful than someone driving very slowly
when no one else is around.
</p>

<p>
The fact that a collision occurred is not itself evidence of
negligence. However, you can and should consider how a collision
occurred when you are determining whether Riley Gardner was negligent.
</p>

<p>
Whether Riley Gardner used reasonable care under the circumstances is
for you, the jury, to determine. If Riley Gardner did not use
reasonable care under the circumstances, then you should find that
he was negligent. If Riley Gardner did use reasonable care under the
circumstances, then you should find that he was not negligent.
</p>
</li>

<li><a id="org96ba6b0"></a>Causation<br />
<p>
As I mentioned earlier, the second thing that Sidney Young must prove
is that, more likely than not, Riley Gardner&rsquo;s negligence caused
Sidney Young’s injuries. You must ask: “Would the same harm have
happened without Riley Gardner’s negligence?” In other words, did the
negligence make a difference? If Riley Gardner’s negligence had an
impact on Sidney Young’s injuries, then it caused those injuries. But
if the negligence had no impact on Sidney Young’s injuries and the
same harm would have happened anyway, then Riley Gardner did not cause the
injuries.
</p>

<p>
Often, an injury has more than one cause. If Riley Gardner’s
negligence was one of those causes, that is enough. Sidney Young does
not have to show that Riley Gardner’s negligence was the only cause of the
injuries. Nor does he have to show that the negligence was the
largest or main cause of the injuries, as long as the injuries would
not have occurred without Riley Gardner’s negligence.
