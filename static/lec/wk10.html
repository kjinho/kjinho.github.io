A noncompetition agreement is enforceable on the condition that it protects an employer’s reasonable competitive business interests, is reasonable as to its duration, geographical area, and line of business. Hyperion’s agreement doesn’t protect its reasonable business interests, is overbroad in line of business; thus it is unenforceable and Hyperion is unlikely to prevent you from joining Avengers.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Writing Style</h1><ol><li>Does the writer use simple, subject-verb-object sentences?</li><li>Does the writer use the active voice?</li><li>Does the writer avoid the overuse of prepositions?</li><li>Does the writer use simple, familiar words?</li><li>Did the writer review the paper for spelling, grammar and typing errors?</li><li>Is the letter free of legalisms?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Recommendations and Instructions</h1><ol><li>Does the writer answer all questions presented clearly and succinctly?</li><li>Does the writer set forth questions, recommendations, and instructions, if any, for the reader?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Example</h1><p>  </p><p>Based upon our understanding of the facts, we believe that the Agreement is not enforceable. Therefore, we suggest that you accept the job offer if you wish to do so. Hyperion may take a legal action, but we believe that we have a good case.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Presentations</h1><ol><li>Roadmap</li><li>Use IRAC</li></ol></div></body>
