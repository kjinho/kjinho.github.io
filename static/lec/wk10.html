You asked me to research whether Rogers has landowner immunity from liability, so that you can sue him for your injury. Unfortunately, the legal analysis suggests that Rogers likely has landowner immunity from liability under Conn. Gen. Stat. §52-557g. Another associate researched and found that the exception to landowner immunity, which is landowner failure to warn, also does not apply here.</li><li>I am writing to answer your question whether you should file a lawsuit against Rogers for your injury in his estate. As you described, Rogers posts several signs on his state to limit the use of his land and charges a $20 parking fee. Based on my analysis, I think Rogers likely has landowner immunity under the Connecticut General Statutes § 52-557g, and as a result, I recommend that you not sue him.</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Review of Facts</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the facts in chronological order?</li><li>Does the writer identify the parties and the nature of the dispute?</li><li>Has the writer included all material facts, including all facts upon which the writer relies in the discussion?</li><li>Has the writer indicated the source of the facts?</li><li>Could the writer have omitted any facts in this section?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Example</h1><p>       </p><ol><li>You have related to us the following facts....</li><li>You have related to me the following facts. Please let me know if I have incorrectly stated the facts, as a change in facts could affect the results of the analysis....</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Opinion</h1><ol><li>Does the writer respond to the question presented?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Examples</h1><ol><li>Under the General Statutes § 52-557g, I think Rogers likely has landowner immunity because his estate is: (1) “available to the public,” (2) “without charge,” and (3) “for recreational purposes.”</li><li>Through analyzing the above statute and facts, we have concluded that Rogers likely satisfies all three requirements to have landowner immunity: (1) the landowner provides his estate to the public; (2) the land comes within the purview of recreational purpose; and (3) the landowner does not charge the admission fee.</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the issues in a logical order?</li><li>Does each paragraph have a topic sentence?</li><li>Are the paragraphs too long (more than 2/3 or 3/4 page)?</li><li>Does the writer analyze the problem thoroughly?</li><li>Does the writer compare specific case facts to the specific facts of problem?</li><li>Does the writer use the IRAC method consistently, setting forth rules, explaining the standard, applying the rules, and coming to a conclusion for each issue?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Example</h1><ol><li>Under the General Statutes of Connecticut, a land owner has no duty to keep the land safe for entry or use by others if (1) the owner makes all or any part of the land available to the public; (2) such availability is free of charge; and (3) such availability is for recreational purposes. Rogers likely does not meet these criteria. </li><li>Second, a court would likely consider Rogers’s estate available to the public for a “recreational purpose.” Indeed, the list enumerated in §52-557f(4) of the Statutes is not-exhaustive, and the Supreme Court in Connecticut confirmed that “recreational purpose” is a broad concept that includes all outdoor activities considered recreational by the person performing them. The activities practicable in Rogers’s estate—i.e., climbing, hiking, and picnicking—seem to fit perfectly the description of the court.</li><li>Third, Rogers’s land is for recreational purposes even though Rogers prohibits swimming and diving.  In <i>Jennett v. United States</i>, the U.S. District Court rejected a claim for landowner immunity where the decedent drowned in a reservoir in which swimming is prohibited, but which was otherwise open to the public for fishing and boating. 597 F. Supp. 110, 113 (D. Conn. 1984).  Rogers’s land prohibits swimming and diving, but allows picnicking, climbing, and hiking, which falls within the definition of “recreational purposes.” Therefore, Rogers’s land is for recreational purposes, even though Rogers prohibits swimming and diving.</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Writing Style</h1><ol><li>Does the writer use simple, subject-verb-object sentences?</li><li>Does the writer use the active voice?</li><li>Does the writer avoid the overuse of prepositions?</li><li>Does the writer use simple, familiar words?</li><li>Did the writer review the paper for spelling, grammar and typing errors?</li><li>Is the letter free of legalisms?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Recommendations and Instructions</h1><ol><li>Does the writer answer all questions presented clearly and succinctly?</li><li>Does the writer set forth questions, recommendations, and instructions, if any, for the reader?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Example</h1><ol><li>For these reasons, Rogers likely has no landowner immunity, and our recommendation is to proceed with your lawsuit.</li><li>Because Rogers likely has landowner immunity under Conn. Gen. Stat. §52-557g, we advise you not to sue Rogers. You could schedule another meeting with me to further discuss possible compensation for your injury.</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Presentations</h1><ol><li>Roadmap</li><li>Use IRAC</li></ol></div></body>
