The document is not in the appropriate format.</td><td>The document fails to comply with the mandated word-count limit, but it includes all necessary sections. The document is in the appropriate format, but there are inconsistencies or errors in the formatting.</td><td>The document complies with the mandated word-count limit and includes all necessary sections. The writer has formatted the document consistently and appropriately.</td></tr></table><h1>Introduction</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The introduction fails to identify the relief requested.</td><td>The introduction identifies the relief requested.</td><td>The introduction identifies the relief requested and provides sufficient context to help the reader understand the issue. The introduction also establishes the trial brief’s themes.</td></tr></table><h1>Background</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The background fails to contain what a reader needs to understand the factual circumstance of the matter. It is unclear who the parties are. It is unclear what the nature of the dispute is. The writer has omitted critically important facts and has included irrelevant and unnecessary information. There is little or no recognizable organization of the facts.</td><td>The background contains most of what a reader needs to understand the factual circumstance of the matter. The writer identifies the parties and nature of the dispute. The writer includes most of the important facts and has omitted most irrelevant or unnecessary information. The organization of the facts is comprehensible, although the writer could improve the organization by using chronological order.</td><td>The background contains everything a reader needs to understand the factual circumstance of the matter. The writer includes a brief introductory paragraph that identifies the parties and the nature of the dispute. The writer organizes the facts clearly and in chronological order. The writer includes all facts that he or she later relies on in the discussion and omits irrelevant and unnecessary information. Where there are conflicting facts, the writer reconciles them appropriately.</td></tr></table><h1>Argument: High-Level Organization</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The writer fails to use IRAC correctly to organize the argument. The argument lacks an introductory paragraph. The writer fails to begin each paragraph with a topic sentence. The argument lacks an appropriate concluding sentence or paragraph.</td><td>The writer uses IRAC to organize the argument. The argument begins with an introductory paragraph that either fails to define the issue, fails to state the correct issue, or fails to state the applicable rule. The introductory paragraph is missing a “roadmap,” or the roadmap that it provides does not match the argument that follows. Some, but not all, of the paragraphs in the argument begin with a topic sentence. The argument lacks an appropriate concluding sentence or paragraph that terminates the IRAC that began in the argument’s introductory paragraph.</td><td>The writer uses IRAC in a clear, consistent way to organize the argument. The argument begins with an introductory paragraph that states the issue and the applicable rule. The introductory paragraph contains a “roadmap” to orient the reader on the analysis that follows. Each paragraph in the argument begins with a topic sentence. The argument ends with an appropriate concluding sentence or paragraph that terminates the IRAC that began in the argument’s introductory paragraph.</td></tr></table><h1>Argument: Element-Level Organization</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The writer fails to include a separate IRAC for each legal element that requires analysis.</td><td>The writer includes a separate IRAC for each legal element that requires analysis. In the IRAC for most of the elements discussed, the writer states the issue and the rule, explains the case law, applies the rule, and and concisely sums up the element in a concluding sentence or sentences. The writer occasionally mixes the order of the “Rule” and “Application” in IRAC, but the ideas expressed still come across clearly.</td><td>The writer includes a separate IRAC for each legal element that requires analysis. The writer sequences the IRACs in a logical way. For each element discussed, the writer—in this order—states the issue and the rule, explains the case law, applies the rule, and sums up the analysis in a concluding sentence or sentences.</td></tr></table><h1>Argument: Analysis</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The writer only performs a cursory analysis and ignores many of the important facts. The writer fails to compare the case law and the problem facts to explain the outcome of the analysis. The writer fails to make the source of authority clear.</td><td>The writer analyzes the problem well, addressing many of the important facts. The writer compares the case law and the problem facts to explain the outcome of the analysis, but the comparisons unnecessarily rely more on distinctions than similarities. The writer makes the source of all authority clear, but the argument is still missing some citations or pinpoint citations where required.</td><td>The writer analyzes the problem thoroughly. The writer addresses all of the facts, organized under appropriate legal elements. The writer relies on positive comparisons between the case law and the problem facts to explain why the outcome of the analysis is similar to the case-law outcome. The writer distinguishes inapposite case law but does not rely excessively on differences between the case law and the problem facts to explain why the outcome of the analysis must be different from the case-law outcome. The writer cites to authority, including pinpoint citations, wherever necessary.</td></tr></table><h1>Conclusion</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The conclusion fails to state the relief requested.</td><td>The conclusion states the relief requested.</td><td>The conclusion states the relief requested clearly and concisely. answers all questions presented clearly and succinctly.</td></tr></table><h1>Style</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The writer uses sentences that are unnecessarily complex or compound. The writer uses the passive voice repeatedly. The writer repeatedly uses incorrect or inappropriates words. Several paragraphs are too short or too long. The document contains numerous spelling, grammar, or typing errors. The citations do not comply with Bluebook form.</td><td>The writer uses mostly simple, subject-verb-object sentences, although some sentences are unnecessarily complex or compound. The writer uses the passive voice more than once in the document. The writer uses correct, but unnecessarily complex words. The paragraphs are mostly of appropriate length (normally at least 2 or 3 sentences long, and no longer than three-quarters of a page). The document contains few spelling, grammar, or typing errors. The citations mostly comply with Bluebook form.</td><td>The writer uses simple, subject-verb-object sentences. The writer uses the active voice and avoids the passive voice. The writer uses simple, familiar words. The writer avoids the overuse of prepositions and prepositional phrases.

The citations comply with Bluebook form.</td></tr></table></div></body>
