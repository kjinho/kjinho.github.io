<p>
When preparing transactional documents, always keep in mind who the
client is. If several parties (e.g., co-founders of a business) ask
you to draft a document for them, it may be necessary to advise them
of the potential conflict of interest and to obtain a written waiver
of the conflict.

<hr />

<p>
One of the shareholders of Vectar Inc. recently approached us
with questions about the effectiveness of a recent vote to remove
Jason Smalls as the president of the company.
</p>

<p>
Vectar Inc. is a Massachusetts domestic corporation. It has five
shareholders, each of whom owns exactly twenty percent of the
outstanding shares. The shares entitle each of the shareholders to
vote at meetings of shareholders. The names of the shareholders are as
follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Jason Smalls</li>
<li>Julia Cannon</li>
<li>Stanley Roy</li>
<li>Samson Coffee</li>
<li>Sarah Knapp</li>

</ul>

<p>
The company was founded three years ago. It is an online software
publisher. The company has fifteen employees and has annual revenues
of roughly three million dollars. The company&rsquo;s principal office is
123 Main Street, Plainview, Massachusetts.
</p>

<p>
Since its founding, the directors of the corporation have been Jason,
Julia, and Stanley. The officers of the corporation have been Jason as
the president, Julia as the treasurer, and Stanley as the secretary
and clerk.
</p>

<p>
The company has articles of organization but no bylaws.
</p>

<p>
Recently, Stanley, Samson, and Sarah have been unhappy with Jason&rsquo;s
conduct as president of the company. Specifically, they have received
complaints from several employees that Jason has been sexually
harassing them. Despite having had several conversations with Jason
about the problem, Stanley, Samson, and Sarah have been unsuccessful
in changing his behavior.
</p>

<p>
Not wanting to wait until the next shareholder or director meeting to
fire Jason, Stanley and Samson and Sarah prepared a signed a document
entitled &ldquo;Written Shareholder Consent.&rdquo; A copy of this document is
enclosed. They signed the document without notice to the other
shareholders, and without a meeting of shareholders.
</p>

<p>
We have serious doubts about the legal effectiveness of the Written
Shareholder Consent. Please draft the discussion section of an
office memo explaining why the Written Shareholder Consent is ineffective
to remove Jason as president of Vectar Inc. Please also draft a notice
of special meeting to remove Jason as president of Vectar Inc.
