In <i>Cheesman</i>, the<br/>debtors’ financial situation placed the family finances in a<br/>deficit if they paid the student loan. <i>Cheesman</i>, 25 F.3d at<br/>360. In <i>Ekenasi</i>, the student loans allowed the debtor to<br/>commence a career in law that improved his circumstances.<br/><i>Ekenasi</i>, 325 F.3d at 548. In the present case, Mr. Ren will<br/>enter a deficit of $250 dollars if he pays the student loan.<br/>Moreover, a health expert has advised him to not commence a career<br/>in law because of the severe depression that has been diagnosed.<br/>Therefore, it is likely that Mr. Ren’s circumstances will persist<br/>for a sizable portion of the repayment period of the student<br/>loans.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Conclusion</h1><ol><li>In the conclusion, does the writer answer all questions presented clearly and succinctly?</li><li>Does the writer set forth questions, if any, and recommendations for the reader?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Style</h1><ol><li>Does the writer use simple, subject-verb-object sentences?</li><li>Does the writer use the active voice?</li><li>Does the writer use simple, familiar words and avoid the overuse of prepositions?</li><li>Are the paragraphs too long (more than 2/3 or 3/4 page)?</li><li>Did the writer review the paper for spelling, grammar and typing errors?</li><li>Do the citations comply with Bluebook form?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Style: Tips</h1><ol><li>Keep your sentences short!</li><li>Definite and indefinite articles (“a,” “an,” “the”): Bouchoux 282-83.</li><li>Punctuation: Commas and periods go inside the quotation marks: Bluebook R5.1(b)(iv).</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Citations: Example for Discussion</h1><p>In <i>Cheesman v. Tennessee Student Assistance Corp.</i>, the Sixth<br/>Circuit found that the Cheesmans could not maintain a minimal<br/>standard of living for their family if they were required to repay<br/>their loans. <i>See Cheesman v. Tenn. Student Assistance<br/>Corp. (In re Cheesman)</i>, 25 F.3d 356, 359 (6th Cir. 1994). The<br/>Cheesmans’ 1992 gross income exceeded by only a slim margin the<br/>government’s 1992 poverty income guideline. <i>Id.</i> And based on<br/>their current situation and employment history, there was no<br/>assurance that their financial condition would improve in the<br/>foreseeable future. <i>Id.</i> at 360. This was one of the main<br/>reasons why the court held that the Cheesmans student loans were<br/>dischargeable. <i>Id.</i> at 359–60.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Editing</h1><ol><li>Focus on clarity.</li><li>Eliminate the unnecessary.</li></ol></div></body>
