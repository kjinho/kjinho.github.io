That’s because the alleged dangerous condition was not apparent enough for Danvers to notice immediately. Also, the condition did not exist for a sufficient length of time to enable Danvers to discover and remove it. So, she is not liable for Lopez’s injuries.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Statement of Facts</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the facts in chronological order?</li><li>Does the writer identify the parties and the nature of the dispute?</li><li>Has the writer included all material facts, including all facts upon which the writer relies in the discussion?</li><li>Could the writer have omitted any facts in this section?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Organization</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the issues in a logical order?</li><li>Does each paragraph have a topic sentence?</li><li>Are the paragraphs too long (more than 2/3 or 3/4 page)?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Analysis</h1><ol><li>Does the writer analyze the problem thoroughly?</li><li>Does the writer support every legal statement with a citation to legal authority?</li><li>Does the writer compare specific case facts to the specific facts of the problem?</li><li>Does the writer use the IRAC method consistently, setting forth rules, explaining the standard, applying the rules, and coming to a conclusion for each issue?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Analysis: Tips</h1><ul><li>“Pyramid” theory</li><ol><li>Assume an ignorant reader.</li><li>To help the reader understand, you need to build a strong foundation.</li><li>Everything you write needs to be built on law and facts you’ve already explained.</li></ol></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Analysis: Example for Discussion</h1><p>The facts do not satisfy the first element because the small pool of olive oil was not apparent. Constructive notice requires that a defect “be visible and apparent.” <i>See Gordon v. Am. Museum of Nat. History</i>, 492 N.E.2d 774, 775 (N.Y. 1986). Here, the small pool of olive oil was transparent, making it hard to see by its very nature. Furthermore, there was not much oil on the floor because most of the oil remained in the oil bottle. Thus, the defect was not be visible and apparent.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Style</h1><ol><li>Does the writer use simple, subject-verb-object sentences?</li><li>Does the writer use the active voice?</li><li>Does the writer avoid the overuse of prepositions?</li><li>Does the writer use simple, familiar words?</li><li>Did the writer review the paper for spelling, grammar and typing errors?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Style: Tips</h1><ol><li>Keep your sentences short!</li><li>Definite and indefinite articles (“a,” “an,” “the”): Bouchoux 282-83.</li><li>Punctuation: Commas and periods go inside the quotation marks: Bluebook R5.1(b)(iv).</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Citations</h1><ol><li>Does the writer cite to authority whenever necessary?</li><li>Do the citations comply with Bluebook form?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Citations: Example for Discussion</h1><p>In <i>Gordon</i>, the injured plaintiff claimed that a piece of white, waxy paper caused him to fall on the defendant’s front entrace steps. <i>Gordon v.
