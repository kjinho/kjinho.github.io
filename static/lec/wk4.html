First, Ren likely cannot maintain a minimal standard of living because his expenses including the loan payment will exceed his net income. Second, Ren’s job and his mental health are likely additional circumstances that will prolong his financial difficulty. Third, Ren has likely made good faith efforts to pay the debt when he negotiated with the loan center about his payment.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Statement of Facts</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the facts in chronological order?</li><li>Does the writer identify the parties and the nature of the dispute?</li><li>Has the writer included all material facts, including all facts upon which the writer relies in the discussion?</li><li>Could the writer have omitted any facts in this section?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Organization</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the issues in a logical order?</li><li>Does each paragraph have a topic sentence?</li><li>Are the paragraphs too long (more than 2/3 or 3/4 page)?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Analysis</h1><ol><li>Does the writer analyze the problem thoroughly?</li><li>Does the writer support every legal statement with a citation to legal authority?</li><li>Does the writer compare specific case facts to the specific facts of the problem?</li><li>Does the writer use the IRAC method consistently, setting forth rules, explaining the standard, applying the rules, and coming to a conclusion for each issue?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Analysis: Tips</h1><ul><li>“Pyramid” theory</li><ol><li>Assume an ignorant reader.</li><li>To help the reader understand, you need to build a strong foundation.</li><li>Everything you write needs to be built on law and facts you’ve already explained.</li></ol></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Analysis: Example for Discussion</h1><p>Under the Bankruptcy Code § 523(a)(8), a debtor must prove his undue hardship to discharge his educational loan. Bankruptcy Code § 523(a)(8), 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(8). To prove the undue hardship, a debtor must show that (1) he cannot “maintain, based on current income and expenses, a ‘minimal’ standard of living for [himself] if forced to repay the loans;” (2) there are “additional circumstances indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans;” and (3) he has made “good faith efforts to repay the loans.” <i>Brunner v. N.Y. State Higher Educ. Serv. Corp.</i>, 831 F.2d 395, 396 (2d Cir. 1987).  Ren will likely be able to prove all three elements.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Style</h1><ol><li>Does the writer use simple, subject-verb-object sentences?</li><li>Does the writer use the active voice?</li><li>Does the writer avoid the overuse of prepositions?</li><li>Does the writer use simple, familiar words?</li><li>Did the writer review the paper for spelling, grammar and typing errors?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Style: Tips</h1><ol><li>Keep your sentences short!</li><li>Definite and indefinite articles (“a,” “an,” “the”): Bouchoux 282-83.</li><li>Punctuation: Commas and periods go inside the quotation marks: Bluebook R5.1(b)(iv).</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Citations</h1><ol><li>Does the writer cite to authority whenever necessary?</li><li>Do the citations comply with Bluebook form?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Citations: Example for Discussion</h1><p>In <i>Cheesman</i>, the Sixth Circuit found that in 1992 the debtors’ gross income exceeded by only a slim margin the government’s poverty income guideline and that the family was maintaining a frugal lifestyle. <i>Cheesman v. Tennessee Student Assistance Corp. (In re Cheesman)</i>, 25 F.3d 356, 359 (6th Cir. 1994).</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Conclusion</h1><ol><li>In the conclusion, does the writer answer all questions presented clearly and succinctly?</li><li>Does the writer set forth questions, if any, and recommendations for the reader?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Editing</h1><ol><li>Focus on clarity.</li><li>Eliminate the unnecessary.</li></ol></div></body>
