The document is not in the appropriate format.</td><td>The document fails to comply with the mandated word-count limit, but it includes all necessary sections. The document is in the appropriate format, but there are inconsistencies or errors in the formatting.</td><td>The document complies with the mandated word-count limit and includes all necessary sections. The writer has formatted the document consistently and appropriately.</td></tr></table></div><div class="slide"><h1>Questions Presented</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The question presented fails to identify the relevant legal theory, fails to include facts for context, and is unanswerable “yes” or “no.”</td><td>The question presented identifies a relevant legal theory, includes factual context, and is answerable “yes” or “no.” The legal theory lacks sufficient specificity. The included facts provide some context but fail to individuate the issue.</td><td>The question presented identifies the relevant legal theory with precision, includes case-specific facts that give the question helpful context, and is answerable “yes” or “no.”</td></tr></table></div><div class="slide"><h1>Questions Presented: Tips</h1><ul><li>Distinguish between the “legal” issue and the “business”/“personal” issue.</li><li>A single question presented should include both facts and law.</li><li>Consider using the “under”/“does”/“when” form: “Under California Civil Code section 3344, does a celebrity have a cause of action for violation of his right of publicity when a business uses his photograph in an advertisement without permission?”</li></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Questions Presented: Example for Discussion</h1><p>Can Richards prove “undue hardship” under § 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code?</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Brief Answer</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The brief answer fails to answer the question presented.</td><td>The brief answer responds to the question presented. The writer offers an explanation to support the answer, but the explanation lacks either sufficient factual detail or a clear organization that addresses all relevant elements of the applicable legal theory.</td><td>The brief answer responds to the question presented and concisely uses specific facts to explain the reason for this conclusion. The writer has organized the brief answer to mirror the elements of the applicable legal theory.</td></tr></table></div><div class="slide"><h1>Brief Answer: Example for Discussion</h1><p>No. Monthly payments of loans does not impose an  “undue hardship” on Richards because he can maintain a minimal standard of living and his bad financial situation will change in foreseeable future.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Statement of Facts</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The statement of facts fails to contain what a reader needs to understand the factual circumstance of the matter. It is unclear who the parties are. It is unclear what the nature of the dispute is. The writer has omitted critically important facts and has included irrelevant and unnecessary information. There is little or no recognizable organization of the facts.</td><td>The statement of facts contains most of what a reader needs to understand the factual circumstance of the matter. The writer identifies the parties and nature of the dispute. The writer includes most of the important facts and has omitted most irrelevant or unnecessary information. The organization of the facts is comprehensible, although the writer could improve the organization by using chronological order.</td><td>The statement of facts contains everything a reader needs to understand the factual circumstance of the matter. The writer includes a brief introductory paragraph that identifies the parties and the nature of the dispute. The writer organizes the facts clearly and in chronological order. The writer includes all facts that he or she later relies on in the discussion and omits irrelevant and unnecessary information.</td></tr></table></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: High-Level Organization</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The writer fails to use IRAC correctly to organize the discussion. The discussion lacks an introductory paragraph. The writer fails to begin each paragraph with a topic sentence. The discussion lacks an appropriate concluding sentence or paragraph.</td><td>The writer uses IRAC to organize the discussion. The discussion begins with an introductory paragraph that either fails to define the issue, fails to state the correct issue, or fails to state the applicable rule. The introductory paragraph is missing a “roadmap,” or the roadmap that it provides does not match the discussion that follows. Some, but not all, of the paragraphs in the discussion begin with a topic sentence. The discussion lacks an appropriate concluding sentence or paragraph that terminates the IRAC that began in the discussion’s introductory paragraph.</td><td>The writer uses IRAC in a clear, consistent way to organize the discussion. The discussion begins with an introductory paragraph that states the issue and the applicable rule. The introductory paragraph contains a “roadmap” to orient the reader on the analysis that follows. Each paragraph in the discussion begins with a topic sentence. The discussion ends with an appropriate concluding sentence or paragraph that terminates the IRAC that began in the discussion’s introductory paragraph.</td></tr></table></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Element-Level Organization</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The writer fails to include a separate IRAC for each legal element that requires analysis.</td><td>The writer includes a separate IRAC for each legal element that requires analysis. In the IRAC for most of the elements discussed, the writer states the issue and the rule, explains the case law, applies the rule, and and concisely sums up the element in a concluding sentence or sentences. The writer occasionally mixes the order of the “Rule” and “Application” in IRAC, but the ideas expressed still come across clearly.</td><td>The writer includes a separate IRAC for each legal element that requires analysis. The writer sequences the IRACs in a logical way. For each element discussed, the writer—in this order—states the issue and the rule, explains the case law, applies the rule, and sums up the analysis in a concluding sentence or sentences.</td></tr></table></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Analysis</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The writer only performs a cursory analysis and ignores many of the important facts. The writer fails to compare the case law and the problem facts to explain the outcome of the analysis. The writer fails to make the source of authority clear.</td><td>The writer analyzes the problem well, addressing many of the important facts. The writer compares the case law and the problem facts to explain the outcome of the analysis, but the comparisons unnecessarily rely more on distinctions than similarities. The writer makes the source of all authority clear, but the discussion is still missing some citations or pinpoint citations where required.</td><td>The writer analyzes the problem thoroughly. The writer addresses all of the facts, organized under appropriate legal elements. The writer relies on positive comparisons between the case law and the problem facts to explain why the outcome of the analysis is similar to the case-law outcome. The writer distinguishes inapposite case law but does not rely excessively on differences between the case law and the problem facts to explain why the outcome of the analysis must be different from the case-law outcome. The writer cites to authority, including pinpoint citations, wherever necessary.</td></tr></table></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Tips</h1><ul><li>“Pyramid” theory</li><ol><li>Assume an ignorant reader.</li><li>To help the reader understand, you need to build a strong foundation.</li><li>Everything you write needs to be built on law and facts you’ve already explained.</li></ol><li>Element-Level Organization</li><ol><li>For simple elements, a single paragraph containing IRAC can suffice.</li><li>For most elements, I recommend splitting IRAC into at least two paragraphs:</li><ol><li>Paragraph 1: Issue and Rule</li><li>Paragraph 2: Application and Conclusion</li></ol><li>Remember that each paragraph must begin with a topic sentence.</li></ol></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Analysis: Example for Discussion</h1><p>Second, additional circumstances exist indicating that<br/>Mr. Richards’s situation is likely to persist for a sizable<br/>portion of the repayment period of the student loans. In<br/><i>Cheesman</i>, the debtors’ financial situation placed the family<br/>finances in a deficit if they paid the student loan.<br/><i>Cheesman</i>, 25 F.3d at 360. In <i>Ekenasi</i>, the student loans<br/>allowed the debtor to commence a career in law that improved his<br/>circumstances. <i>Ekenasi</i>, 325 F.3d at 548. In the present case,<br/>Mr. Richards will enter a deficit of $250 dollars if he pays the<br/>student loan. Moreover, a health expert has advised him to not<br/>commence a career in law because of the severe depression that has<br/>been diagnosed. Therefore, it is likely that Mr. Richards’s<br/>circumstances will persist for a sizable portion of the repayment<br/>period of the student loans.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Conclusion</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The conclusion fails to answer the questions presented. The conclusion lacks questions or recommendations for the reader.</td><td>The conclusion answers all questions presented. The conclusion also contains questions or recommendations for the reader. These questions or recommendations are either minimally relevant or largely unhelpful.</td><td>The conclusion answers all questions presented clearly and succinctly. The conclusion also contains relevant and helpful questions or recommendations for the reader.</td></tr></table></div><div class="slide"><h1>Style</h1><table><tr><th>1</th><th>3</th><th>5</th></tr><tr><td>The writer uses sentences that are unnecessarily complex or compound. The writer uses the passive voice repeatedly. The writer repeatedly uses incorrect or inappropriates words. Several paragraphs are too short or too long. The document contains numerous spelling, grammar, or typing errors. The citations do not comply with Bluebook form.</td><td>The writer uses mostly simple, subject-verb-object sentences, although some sentences are unnecessarily complex or compound. The writer uses the passive voice more than once in the document. The writer uses correct, but unnecessarily complex words. The paragraphs are mostly of appropriate length (normally at least 2 or 3 sentences long, and no longer than three-quarters of a page). The document contains few spelling, grammar, or typing errors. The citations mostly comply with Bluebook form.</td><td>The writer uses simple, subject-verb-object sentences. The writer uses the active voice and avoids the passive voice. The writer uses simple, familiar words. The writer avoids the overuse of prepositions and prepositional phrases. The paragraphs are of appropriate length (normally at least 2 or 3 sentences long, and no longer than three-quarters of a page). The document is free of spelling, grammar, and typing errors. The citations comply with Bluebook form.</td></tr></table></div><div class="slide"><h1>Style: Tips</h1><ol><li>Keep your sentences short!</li><li>Definite and indefinite articles (“a,” “an,” “the”): Bouchoux 282-83.</li><li>Punctuation: Commas and periods go inside the quotation marks: Bluebook R5.1(b)(iv).</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Citations: Example for Discussion</h1><p>In <i>Cheesman v. Tennessee Student Assistance Corp.</i>, the Sixth<br/>Circuit found that the Cheesmans could not maintain a minimal<br/>standard of living for their family if they were required to repay<br/>their loans. <i>See Cheesman v. Tenn. Student Assistance<br/>Corp. (In re Cheesman)</i>, 25 F.3d 356, 359 (6th Cir. 1994).
