As you requested, we have researched whether Boseman has landowner immunity for your injuries while visiting his open estate for free under Connecticut Law.</li><li>I would like to thank you for coming to our offices last week when we discussed your issue about the accident you had on Boseman’s estate and the question whether it makes sense to sue Boseman. Following our conversation, I would like to provide you with some more information. First, let me summarize my understanding of the facts.</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Review of Facts</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the facts in chronological order?</li><li>Does the writer identify the parties and the nature of the dispute?</li><li>Has the writer included all material facts, including all facts upon which the writer relies in the discussion?</li><li>Has the writer indicated the source of the facts?</li><li>Could the writer have omitted any facts in this section?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Example</h1><p>You have related to us the following facts....</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Opinion</h1><ol><li>Does the writer respond to the question presented?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Examples</h1><ol><li>Based on the facts you provided us and the applicable law in Connecticut, we feel it will be easy to prove Boseman has landowner immunity and we have concluded that cases similar to yours have been unsuccessful.</li><li>Based upon the facts you provided us and the applicable law, it is our opinion that Chadwick Boseman has landowner immunity.</li><li>In my opinion, you may not able to obtain any remedy from Boseman because he satisfies the elements that make him immune from liability.</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the issues in a logical order?</li><li>Does each paragraph have a topic sentence?</li><li>Are the paragraphs too long (more than 2/3 or 3/4 page)?</li><li>Does the writer analyze the problem thoroughly?</li><li>Does the writer compare specific case facts to the specific facts of problem?</li><li>Does the writer use the IRAC method consistently, setting forth rules, explaining the standard, applying the rules, and coming to a conclusion for each issue?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Example</h1><p>Boseman has landowner immunity because he satisfies the requirements of the Recreational Land Use Act. The Act provides that a landowner has immunity from visitors’ injuries if (1) his estate is available to the public; (2) he does not charge anyone to enter his estate; and (3) his estate is open for recreational purposes. As we explain in detail below, Boseman satisfies all three of these elements.</p></div><div class="slide"><p>For his estate to be available to the public, Boseman must prove that many visitors are using his land and they can access his land by various means. Because there are five free parking spots and one parking area for charges with a bike rack, visitors can get to Boseman’s land by car or bike. Because the cliffs in Boseman’s estate are “known to be great for rock climbing,” not only you but also other rock climbers go climbing there. Although Boseman posted some signs that restricted the use of the pond and the open time, his land is still available to the public because courts allow landowners to place reasonable restrictions on their property.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Writing Style</h1><ol><li>Does the writer use simple, subject-verb-object sentences?</li><li>Does the writer use the active voice?</li><li>Does the writer avoid the overuse of prepositions?</li><li>Does the writer use simple, familiar words?</li><li>Did the writer review the paper for spelling, grammar and typing errors?</li><li>Is the letter free of legalisms?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Recommendations and Instructions</h1><ol><li>Does the writer answer all questions presented clearly and succinctly?</li><li>Does the writer set forth questions, recommendations, and instructions, if any, for the reader?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Example</h1><p>  </p><p>In our professional opinion, Boseman will not have great difficulty proving these above points. We have based this opinion upon the facts you have provided us, and we think that we have a less than even chance of proving he is legally responsible for your injuries. Therefore, we suggest that you’d better not sue him.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Presentations</h1><ol><li>Roadmap</li><li>Use IRAC</li></ol></div><div class="handout"><h1>Pairings</h1><ul><li>Blanca—Jinal</li><li>David—Yiyi</li><li>Jishuang—Camill</li><li>Cindy—Kassandra</li><li>Lanyue—Luhan</li></ul></div></body>
