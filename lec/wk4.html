Ren meets the standard of “undue hardship,” because he has few opportunities to repay the loan in the short term, thus establishing that his inability to maintain a minimal living standard will persist for a significant portion of the payment period. Ren modified his repayment plan and made the first 6 payments, thus establishing that Ren made good-faith efforts.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Statement of Facts</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the facts in chronological order?</li><li>Does the writer identify the parties and the nature of the dispute?</li><li>Has the writer included all material facts, including all facts upon which the writer relies in the discussion?</li><li>Could the writer have omitted any facts in this section?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Organization</h1><ol><li>Does the writer present the issues in a logical order?</li><li>Does each paragraph have a topic sentence?</li><li>Are the paragraphs too long (more than 2/3 or 3/4 page)?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Analysis</h1><ol><li>Does the writer analyze the problem thoroughly?</li><li>Does the writer support every legal statement with a citation to legal authority?</li><li>Does the writer compare specific case facts to the specific facts of problem?</li><li>Does the writer use the IRAC method consistently, setting forth rules, explaining the standard, applying the rules, and coming to a conclusion for each issue?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Analysis: Tips</h1><ul><li>“Pyramid” theory</li><ol><li>Assume an ignorant reader.</li><li>To help the reader understand, you need to build a strong foundation.</li><li>Everything you write needs to be built on law and facts you’ve already explained.</li></ol></ul></div><div class="slide"><h1>Analysis: Example for Discussion</h1><p>The third issue is whether Mr. Ren made good faith efforts to repay the loans. A debtor acts in good faith if she has made payments and seeks a remedy. For example, in <i>Cheesman</i>, Cheesman made payments on their loans for at least one year before filing for bankruptcy and worked in worthwhile professions notwithstanding the low salary. <i>Cheesman</i>, 25 F.3d at 360. The Court held that Cheesman acted in good faith. <i>Id.</i> Here, Mr. Ren made the first six payments after he successfully reached an agreement with the Loan Center to reduce the payment. Furthermore, he kept looking for legal positions and work consistently. Just like Cheesman, he made efforts to pay the loan within his ability. <i>Id.</i> Therefore, Mr. Ren probably acted in good faith to repay the loans.</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Style</h1><ol><li>Does the writer use simple, subject-verb-object sentences?</li><li>Does the writer use the active voice?</li><li>Does the writer avoid the overuse of prepositions?</li><li>Does the writer use simple, familiar words?</li><li>Did the writer review the paper for spelling, grammar and typing errors?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Style: Tips</h1><ol><li>Keep your sentences short!</li><li>Definite and indefinite articles (“a,” “an,” “the”): Bouchoux 282-83.</li><li>Punctuation: Commas and periods go inside the quotation marks: Bluebook R5.1(b)(iv).</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Discussion: Citations</h1><ol><li>Does the writer cite to authority whenever necessary?</li><li>Do the citations comply with Bluebook form?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Citations: Example for Discussion</h1><p>In <i>Cheesman</i>, the Sixth Circuit was satisfied that the Cheesmans could not maintain a minimal standard of living when they found the Cheesmans had a monthly deficit of approximately $400. <i>Cheesman v. Tenn. Student Assistance Corp. (In re Cheesman)</i>, 25 F.3d 356, 359-60 (6th Cir. 1994).</p></div><div class="slide"><h1>Conclusion</h1><ol><li>In the conclusion, does the writer answer all questions presented clearly and succinctly?</li><li>Does the writer set forth questions, if any, and recommendations for the reader?</li></ol></div><div class="slide"><h1>Editing</h1><ol><li>Focus on clarity.</li><li>Eliminate the unnecessary.</li></ol></div></body>
